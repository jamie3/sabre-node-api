# Sabre Node API

A collection of Sabre SOAP APIs exposed via a simpler RESTful API within a node app. I f***in hate soap, so this alleviates some of the pain. This is actively under development so please do not use it in production.

## Pre-Requisites



## Start

`yarn start`

## API

Below are the list of APIs that are exposed over Restful interface.
